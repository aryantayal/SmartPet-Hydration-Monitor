SmartPet Hydration Monitor is a comprehensive solution designed to ensure the optimal health and well-being of your pets by precisely tracking their water consumption. The heart of this project lies in its user-friendly and intuitive User Interface (UI), providing pet owners with real-time insights into their pets' hydration habits.

#Key Features:

##RFID-Powered Pet Identification:
The system utilizes RFID dog tags, uniquely assigned to each pet, enabling precise tracking of individual water consumption.
These tags ensure accurate data collection, allowing pet owners to monitor the hydration levels of each pet separately.
##Real-time Water Consumption Tracking:
The UI displays real-time data on the amount of water consumed by each pet.
Users can easily access historical consumption patterns, helping them identify any deviations or irregularities.
##Customizable Hydration Parameters:
Pet owners have the flexibility to set personalized hydration goals for each pet.
Adjustable parameters include the minimum and maximum water levels in the reservoir, ensuring a tailored approach to each pet's unique needs.
##Automated Water Dispensing:
In the event that the water level falls below the minimum set by the user, the system triggers an automatic water dispensing mechanism.
Smart sensors ensure that the correct amount of water is dispensed, maintaining the reservoir at optimal levels for each pet.
##User-Friendly Interface:
The UI is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing users to easily navigate through pet profiles, hydration statistics, and system settings.
Alerts and notifications are displayed prominently, keeping pet owners informed about any issues or low water levels.
##Data Analytics and Insights:
The system collects and analyzes historical data to provide insights into long-term hydration trends.
Graphical representations and charts are available on the UI, facilitating a deeper understanding of each pet's water consumption patterns.
Mobile Compatibility: The UI is accessible through a webserver hosted on a raspberrypi, providing pet owners with the convenience of monitoring their pets' hydration status remotely.

SmartPet Hydration Monitor is not just a user interface; it's a holistic solution that combines advanced technology, user customization, and automated processes to ensure the well-being of your pets through optimal hydration management.
